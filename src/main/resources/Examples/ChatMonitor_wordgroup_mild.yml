 # This file represents a starting point to cover many of the known iterations of
 # offensive language in English. You can use this configuration setup, and especially
 # the list of words below, to kickstart the plugin to start muting offensive language.
 # Set up the rest of the actions, message, commands and muting options per your specifications.

 # Don't forget to add 'offensive' to your config.yml list of groups.

 # Message displayed to the user (or broadcast in general chat)
 # if a word in the list matches user text.
 # You can use magic words that will be replaced before the message
 # is sent to the user:
 # - %player% the player whose message triggered the match
 # - %word% the word that was caught
 # - %matchrule% the rule (in the list below) that was triggered on the matched word
message: 'This word ("%word%") is not allowed on this server.'
 # Send the response message to the entire chat. If false, the message is only visible to the user whose text matched the word from the list.
broadcast: false

 # A list of words to trigger the behavior of this group. This is a regular expression list. If words are added plainly, they will match anywhere in the string. Example: 'foo' will match 'food' and 'blafoo'. For comlpex behavior, like limiting word boundaries and alternative spellings, see regular expression documentation, and visit the ChatMonitor wiki for example lists.

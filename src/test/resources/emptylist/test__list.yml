 # - %word% the word that was caught
 # - %matchrule% the rule (in the list below) that was triggered on the matched word

 # A list of words to trigger the behavior of this group. This is a regular expression list. If words are added plainly, they will match anywhere in the string. Example: 'foo' will match 'food' and 'blafoo'. For comlpex behavior, like limiting word boundaries and alternative spellings, see regular expression documentation, and visit the ChatMonitor wiki for example lists.
